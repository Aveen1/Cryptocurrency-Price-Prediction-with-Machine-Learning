# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction with Machine Learning
Predicting the future prices of cryptocurrency is based on the problem of Time series analysis. 
The AutoTS library in Python is one of the best libraries for time series analysis.
So here I used the AutoTS library to predict the bitcoin prices for a month.

The ultimate goal of the project is to develop accurate and reliable models that can predict the future prices of cryptocurrencies with a high degree of accuracy. 
Such models could be useful for investors and traders who want to make informed decisions about buying and selling cryptocurrencies. 
The project also has broader implications for the field of machine learning, as it demonstrates the potential of these techniques for predicting complex financial phenomena.
